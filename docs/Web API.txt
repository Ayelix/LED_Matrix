        "description" - string, further description of the mode.
            Ex: "Scroll text aross the matrix"
        "index" - int, index of the mode in the mode list.  Required to access

        "type" - string, identifies the type of value this setting takes.
            Described in the next section.
        <value parameter> - variable type, gives the current value of the
            setting.  The name of this member depends on the setting type (see
            next section).
        "index" - int, index of the setting in its mode's settings list.

********************************************************************************
Setting Types
********************************************************************************
There are several types of settings.  Each type takes a different type of value
to adjust the behavior of a mode.  To make sure the right type of value is being
used with the /setSetting request, each type of setting requires a different
parameter name for the value to be set.  Currently, all value parameter names
are the same as the type name for the setting, but this may change.  The types
of settings, listed by their corresponding "type" string, are:

"string" - takes a string value in the "string" parameter.
"number" - takes an integer or floating-point value in the "number" parameter.

    Success:    Status 200 OK with mode list in JSON body with the form:
                {
                  "numModes" : <number of available modes>,
                  "modes": [<array of "mode" objects as described above>],
                  "currentMode" : <index of current mode>
                }
    Error:      Status other than 200 OK with optional string description in
                body.

/setMode - update current mode
    Example:    /setMode?mode=1
    Params:     mode - index of the mode to set as current mode.
    Success:    Status 200 OK with same output as /getModes.
    Error:      Status other than 200 OK with optional string description in
                body.

/getSettings - get available settings for a mode
    Example:    /getSettings?mode=1
    Params:     mode - index of the mode for which settings are returned.
    Success:    Status 200 OK with mode and settings in JSON body with the form:
                {
                  "mode": <"mode" object as described above>,
                  "numSettings": <number of available settings for the mode>,
                  "settings": [<array of "setting" objects as described above>]
                }
    Error:      Status other than 200 OK with optional string description in
                body.

/setSetting - change a setting for a mode
    Example:    /setSetting?mode=1&setting=1&string="New%20text"
    Params:     mode - index of the mode whose setting is being changed.
                setting - index of the setting in the mode's setting list.
                <value parameter> - new value for the setting (value parameter
                    name depends on the setting type).
    Success:    Status 200 OK with same output as /getSettings.
    Error:      Status other than 200 OK with optional string description in
