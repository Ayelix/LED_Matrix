  The steps taken were:
  1. Add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list:
     deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi
  2. Create the file /etc/apt/preferences with the following contents:
     Package: *
     Pin: release n=wheezy
     Pin-Priority: 900

     Package: *
     Pin: release n=jessie
     Pin-Priority: 300

     Package: *
     Pin: release o=Raspbian
     Pin-Priority: -10
  3. Update package list:
     sudo apt-get update
  4. Install the libpion-dev package from the jessie distribution:
     sudo apt-get install -t jessie libpion-dev
  5. The libboost1.54-all-dev package might also be needed:
     sudo apt-get install -t jessie libboost1.54-all-dev
  The very long and manual install process attempted first is recorded in console
  script file pion-install.script.
